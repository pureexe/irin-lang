## How to scripting irin

irin language has divided into two part that call Head and Body. In head use to define variable and body use to define question and answer for chatterbot. You can scripting without head. irin script must save in `.irin` file extension. In body use indent to descibe question or answer. You can indent by use Tab or space. Here is example.

```
Hello
  Hi
```
when you type `hello`. Don't worry about case sensitive on question. bot will reply `Hi!`. Line without indent always question. And greater deep level is answer. And next greater level is question.
